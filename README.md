# hello-world
This repository will first be used to organize my web site TonyDuqueDesign.com
After graduating from FSU in Computer Science I worked as a programmer. At Edmark Corp. I worked in other areas of the software development cycle, including QA, Tech Support, and creating digital art work. In 1997, I combined my programming and my art abilities to become a web developer.
